# Custmer_Complaint_Dashboard
Project Overview

This Tableau project provides a comprehensive dashboard that helps to analyze customer complaints across different products and states. The dashboard is designed to assist business stakeholders in visualizing key insights, trends, and patterns in customer complaints to improve product quality and customer satisfaction.

Key Features:-

  Interactive Dashboard: The dashboard offers an intuitive and interactive interface for exploring customer complaints.
 
  Parameters: Two parameters are created to dynamically filter the data:
     
   Product Selector: Allows the user to filter and analyze complaints for specific products.
   
   State Selector: Allows the user to filter complaints by individual states or regions.
 
  Visualization: The dashboard includes charts and graphs for trend analysis, showing the number of complaints by product and state over time.
 
Project Structure:-

  Data Source: The data used for this dashboard includes customer complaints related to different products and locations.
 
  Tableau Dashboard: The dashboard is built with Tableau Desktop using the parameters to allow dynamic data filtering and analysis.

How to Use the Dashboard:-

 1. Open the Tableau file in Tableau Desktop.

 2. Use the Product Selector parameter to select a specific product for analysis.

 3. Use the State Selector parameter to focus on complaints from a particular state or region.

 4. Explore the dashboard's charts and visualizations to gain insights into the trends and patterns of customer complaints.

 5. Filter values will adjust automatically based on the parameters chosen, allowing you to switch between products and states seamlessly.


Prerequisites:-

  Tableau Desktop (2020.1 or later)
 
  Basic knowledge of Tableau to interact with the dashboard effectively.


Future Enhancements:-

  Adding more parameters for advanced filtering (e.g., date range).
 
  Enhancing visualizations with detailed drill-downs.
 
  Integrating with live databases for real-time updates. 

NOTE :- For the connection we have to connect the complaints full data with the state full data by performing the inner join on state and abbrivation table.
